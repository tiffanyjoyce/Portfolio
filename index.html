                        <p>I was previously a Georgia State University who initially went in majoring in biology to go
                            into the medical field. After 2 years, I realized I was no longer passionate about anything
                            having to do with working in a hospital so I made a change to psychology. I enjoyed
                            psychology; However I had no real plan for what I would do with that degree. I took a couple
                            of intro to computer science classes and was very intrigued which led me here!</p>
